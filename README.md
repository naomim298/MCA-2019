# MCA Week 1

# Fleetwood Mac

**My chosen theme for the dataset is Fleetwood Mac. I am a big fan and believe that their vast works will give me a flexible basis for my work this semester.**

[\] data available on Fleetwood Mac, like many other major band, is incredibly huge and diverse. There are, of course many playlists across the major streaming facilities; including both playlists of solely their own works nd carefully created playlists, which are centered around a particular genre or era. For example, you will find their music featured on the Spotify playlist, 'All out 70s' and 'The Rocklist'. 
 
[\] Descriptive: Data specifics including albums, release dates, genre, era, sales figures, number of plays across streaming platforms, length of albums and songs, followers, monthly listeners and biographies. I have specifically found this data on Spotify, when viewing the artists' but much of this information is easily found on the web. 
 
[\] Notated: To obtain sheet music, it's usually necessary to purchase copies. However, with Musescore, access to computerised copies of sheet music is free. Here I could look at piano, percussion, saxophone and wind instruments for various songs by Fleetwood Mac. 
 
[\] Acoustic: Live concerts and acoustic sessions can easily be accessed via YouTube.
