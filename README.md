# MCA Week 1

# Fleetwood Mac
My chosen theme for the dataset is **Fleetwood Mac**. I am a big fan and believe that their vast works will give me a flexible basis for my work this semester.

The data available on Fleetwood Mac, like many other major band, is incredibly huge and diverse. There are of course many playlists across the major streaming facilities; including both playlists of solely their own works, and carefully created playlists, which are centered around a particular genre or era. For example, you will find their music featured on the Spotify playlist, 'All out 70s' and 'The Rocklist', amongst many others.

**Descriptive**: Data specifics including albums, release dates,Â genre, era, sales figures, number of plays across streaming platforms, length of albums and songs, followers, monthly listeners and biographies. I have specifically accessed most of this data on Spotify, when viewing the artists' profile but much of this information is easily found on the web. However, certain data sets can be more difficult to obtain without paying a company such as Gracenote for access. Gracenote present information clearly through charts and tables to reveal possible artist influences, similarities in genre, tempo and audio analysis.

**Notated**: To obtain sheet music, it's usually necessary to purchase copies. However with Musescore, access to computerised copies of sheet music is free. Here I could looke at piano, percussion, saxophone and wind instrument sheetmusic for multiple Fleetwood Mac songs.

**Acoustic**: Live concerts and acoustic sessions can easily be accessed via YouTube.
