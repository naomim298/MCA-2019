      The above images feature the first four pages of the song, 'Gypsy' by Fleetwood Mac (as in line with my recurring theme).
      The first image is the default MuseScore notation representation.
      The second image on the otherhand, was generated by exporting the MuseScore notation above, as a wav file. It was then transcribed
      using Sonic Visualiser and once again loaded into Musecore, which consequently produced a different result.
