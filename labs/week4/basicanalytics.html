<h1>Week 4: Basic Analytics</h1>
  Each of the three graphs represent pitch in different formats and are based on features I extracted which I thought were
  most relevant to my piece, using jSymbolic.
<a href="https://github.com/naomim298/MCA-2019/blob/master/labs/week4/extractedfeaturesfile.xml">Here, </a>
is the file containing the features that I extracted.

  <h4>Piano Roll of Pitches</h4>

  <p>This graph shows where and which pitches occur alone or simultaneously throughout the 10 measures of the song provided. Note
    B seems to occur the most consistently, appearing in measures 3, 4, 6, 7, 8. Whereas, note F only occurs once briefly in measure 8.

  <h4>Pitch Histogram</h4>

  <p>The second graph shows at which count that certain octaves occur more frequently. For exmaple, C2 occurs
    at the highest counts of about 48 and 55.
  </p>

  <h4>Scatter Plot of Pitches</h4>
    <img src="scatterplotofpitches.png" alt="scatter plot of pitches." height="500" width="500">
    <p>The Scatter plot shows the pitches that occur at different quarter lengths. There seems to be a much greater 
    freqeuncy occuring at Quarter Length 0.5 with all pitches occring at this time aside from D. Wheres at 
    Quarter Length 3.5, the frequency is much less with only 3 pitches occuring: B, E and A.
