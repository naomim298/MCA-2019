<h1>Fleetwood Mac</h1>
<p>My chosen theme for the dataset is Fleetwood Mac. I am a big fan and of their work, and there is a large scope of data about them
  available due to their popularity and vast collection of works.</p>

<p>
The data available on Fleetwood Mac, like many other major band, is incredibly huge and diverse. There are of course many playlists across the major
  streaming facilities; including both playlists of solely their own works, and carefully curated playlists, which are centered around a particular genre or era. For example, you will find their music featured on the Spotify playlist, 'All out 70s' and 'The Rocklist', amongst many others.</p>

</p><bold>Descriptive:</bold> Data specifics including albums, release dates,Â genre, era, sales figures, number of plays across streaming platforms,
  length of albums and songs, followers, monthly listeners and biographies. I have specifically accessed most of this data on Spotify, when viewing the artists' profile but much of this information is easily found on the web. However, certain data sets can be more difficult to obtain without paying a company such as Gracenote for access. Gracenote present information clearly through charts and tables to reveal possible artist influences, similarities in genre, tempo and audio analysis.</p>

<p><bold>Notated:</bold> To obtain sheet music, it's usually necessary to purchase copies. However it is quite easy to obtain when only requiring the first
10 bars of a song, as they are often shown in a preview.</p>

<p><bold>Acoustic:</bold> Live concerts and acoustic sessions can easily be accessed via YouTube. Their music can also be found on all
major streaming platforms including Spotify, Apple Music and Amazon music.
