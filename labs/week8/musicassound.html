  <h2>Task 3: Time Frequency Analysis versus Waveform Based Analysis</h2>
  Time frequency analysis as opposed to waveform based analysis is more beneficial and proivides for more accurate analyis as it is applicable<br>
  to the duration of sound frquencies produced, whereas waveform analysis suggests that the sounds observed are continuous. Time frequency analysis<br>
  allows for differening times and frequencies to be visualised together, allowing a specific aspect of sound to be analysed. For example, in the<br>
  third track that I extracted features from, it can be seen
