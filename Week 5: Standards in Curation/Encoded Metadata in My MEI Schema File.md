# Metadata added to my MEI file? Schema
I have included the original MEI document in the folder for this week's task so that a comparison can be made between
the original/preset data components and the new data that I have encoded.

## Some of the additional elements I have encoded in my MEi file include:
1. fileDesc
 1. title(songtitle)
 2. identifier
 3. respStmt
 4. editionStmt
 5. pubStmt
 6. availability
2. encodingDesc
 1. application
3. workDesc
 1. key
 2. tempo
 3.language
 4. classification: genres
