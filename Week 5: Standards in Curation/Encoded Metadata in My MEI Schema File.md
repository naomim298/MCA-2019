# Metadata added to my MEI File/Schema
I have included the original MEI document in the folder for this week's task so that a comparison can be made between
the original/preset data components and the new data that I have encoded.

## Some of the additional elements I have encoded in my MEi file include:
**fileDesc**

 * title(songtitle)
 * identifier
 * respStmt
 * editionStmt
 * pubStmt
 * availability
**encodingDesc**

 * application
**workDesc**

 * key
 * tempo
 * language
 * classification: genres
